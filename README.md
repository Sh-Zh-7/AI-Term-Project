# Hands on Digits Recognizer
Digits recognition is a vital part in machine learning. Not only it is a **"Hello World" level demo for many of the machine learning beginners**, but also it plays a vital part in many modern machine-learning-based applications, such as **OCR, CAPTCHA recognition, LPR** and so on.

It's a little bit useless for the beginners to using machine learning library like `sklearn` etc to perform the machine learning project. If you want to improve your machine learning skills quickly, you'd better implement the algorithm by yourself.

Therefore, an idea comes from my mind to offer the beginners of machine learning and deep learning a repo to teach them how to implement the classic model, and how to use the model in real-world project. And of course digit recognizer is a good choice.

# Project Structure

This repo include 3 models:

1.  **KNN model**.
2.  **SVM model**.
3. **Simple CNN model**.

Remember, since the digits data set has many forms, I choose different data set as well, **which means the 3 modules don't share the same data set**.

The 2 datasets I used here are from **Machine Learning in Action book's resources** and **Kaggle's mnist data set**.
